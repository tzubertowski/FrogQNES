# 🐸 FrogQNES  
**Minimal libretro-QuickNES port for PSP**  

Super small, **super compatible**, and **super fast** NES emulator with modern features.  

Unlike older PSP NES emulators, FrogNES delivers **up-to-date software** built around the libretro ecosystem.  
It includes several **MIPS32 optimizations** ported from my previous SF2000 work, ensuring top performance on real hardware.
